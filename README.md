# Grid Package Sorting System

Developed a moving cart system to automatically sort packages based on their destination addresses, transporting them from the packaging unit to the delivery unit on a grid-based platform. The cart's movements and optimal routes are managed by a Raspberry Pi, which utilizes image processing algorithms to monitor and guide the cart along the shortest paths efficiently.
